## About

I've recently started tinkering with electronics, so created this toy project
to learn the resistor color codes.

Currently this displays a four-band resistor as apparently this is most common,
but the fourth tolerance band isn't implemented (yet).

## Installation

Install `rescol` using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/TomJGooding/rescol.git
```
